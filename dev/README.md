# Development for Masters Project 2018

## Important
Go to LINK TO OMNIGLOT and download the OMNIGLOT dataset. Put the whole dataset in a folder you call "raw" @ data/omniglot/, and the scripts will do the rest.

## Models
Here we have three different models:

1. LSTM Baseline model
Implemented from "Active One-Shot Learning" (https://cs.stanford.edu/~woodward/papers/active_one_shot_learning_2016.pdf). This is used as a baseline for my experiments with different memory structures.

2. NTM Model
Implemented partially from https://github.com/loudinthecloud/pytorch-ntm, with added functionality similar to "Active One-Shot Learning" and "Meta-Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks" (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/santoro16.pdf). 

3. LRUA Model
Simply an augmented version of the NTM model, similar to the LRUA in http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/santoro16.pdf. The only difference is that the number of read heads is identical to the number of write heads, and that every memory location is either written to the least used location, or simply the first location, in memory.
